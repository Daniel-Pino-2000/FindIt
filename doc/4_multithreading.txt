2 - Change the program so that the index() function runs on its own Thread.
The program should start immediately and allow the user to begin searching.
We must handle the following cases:
- The initial creation of the index.sqlite database (fresh start). In this
  case we should index in the background and let the user now that any
  searches will not have the full results (e.g. a message like 
  "Indexing in the background, results may not be complete.")
- Updating the index.sqlite in the background, let the user know that results
  may not be up to date (e.g. a message like "Updating index in the background,
  results may not be complete.")
- Once the index is updated, these messages should not be shown during searches.
3 - Write a new Logging class that is thread-safe. Currently if you call
print() from different threads, it is possible that the printed output looks
weird, we should lock calls to print so that we don't have this issue.
