Program Changes: 
* Change your program so that a user can perform multiple searches during one
  launch. e.g.:
  > file hello*.txt
  tmp/hello.txt
  tmp/hello1.txt
  > file hello1.txt
  tmp/hello1.txt
  > quit 
  (exits the program)

* Change your program so that it creates an index in RAM as you suggested. 
  Use this index to make multiple searches faster.
  We can do this by using our existing code but writing the paths to a data 
  structure for later use (up to you to figure out which one should be used
  to store the data (string, list, dictionary, set, etc.). Think of what 
  information you need to store for each path so that your program will
  remember what to search. I have added 3 options to the TEST variable, a
  local test with the test/ directory, a user path test (C:\Users\Daniel) and
  a root test (C:\\). 

  BEFORE RUNNING YOUR PROGRAM ON ROOT, SAVE YOUR WORK AND CLOSE EVERYTHING YOU DON'T NEED. 

  Your program will most likely run out of RAM and your computer might get slow, 
  have the task manager open and kill it. Nothing bad will happen, but it's 
  good to see how a program can exhaust memory.
