# FindIt

Project Description:
This application shows the path to the file or directory you need to find. I tried to do this the fastest way posible so I used a database through
the library sqlite3. In the future I would like to implement multithreading to improve the app.

How to use it:
You can execute a search using different commands depending on what you need to find:

Commands:
1-file
2-directory
3-all

Example:
file music.mp3
directory Movies
all *games*
